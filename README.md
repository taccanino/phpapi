# phpapi

My simple, but effective, PHP project with homemade dependency injection container.
The project already contains some basic classes to inject common functionalities like database, routing, caching, etc.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taccanino/phpapi
cd phpapi
```
You are ready to go, that is the nice thing about good old php. No frameworks, no composer, no dependencies, just a simple file structure and a few classes to help you out.
